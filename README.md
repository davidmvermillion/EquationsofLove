# EquationsofLove
Equations and graphs for Valentine's Day.
Contributions are welcomed.

I designed this project as a Valentine's Day card for my wife. The HTML and PDF files are the *final* product, although they still look rather rough.\
I created the plots in the FirstEquations.R file.
The Markdown files are how I created the final products.\
I chose to use images to nicely align everything. SVGs work fine in HTML. I had to use JPEGs in the PDF. If you know of a way to use SVGs instead, I would love to hear.

I found the [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/here/vignettes/rmarkdown.html) package to help with directory work within folders.
